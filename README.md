# Algorithm & Data Structure Challenges

This repository is dedicated to solving various algorithmic and data structure challenges. The content primarily focuses on common interview problems that test key concepts and problem-solving skills in these areas.

## Topics Covered

Here, you will find solutions and explanations for a wide range of topics including, but not limited to:

- Sorting algorithms
- Tree and graph traversal
- Dynamic programming
- Searching algorithms
- Complexity analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide clear examples and thorough explanations for different algorithmic strategies and data structure implementations. It's aimed at helping individuals prepare for technical interviews and improve their coding proficiency.

## Usage

Each directory within the repository is structured around specific topics. Under each directory, you'll find a set of problems labeled accordingly with their solutions and a README file explaining the problem statement and the approach taken in the solution.

Feel free to explore the problems, try to solve them on your own, and refer to the solutions to check your work or gain new insights.

## Contributing
